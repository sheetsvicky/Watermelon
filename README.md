# Watermelon

A board game from my childhood with artificial intelligence 

1) Like GO, one or more stones will be out if they are closed by stones from another side. Losing more than three stones will lose the game.

2) In each step, one stone is allowed to be moved to a neighboring gap position by clicking the stone and then clicking the gap.

3) The player (red) takes the first step. The AI that controls green is selected in manu "AI".

For my grandmother and grandfather.
